YieldUp is a web application that can be used by farmers to detect crop diseases mainly in cassava, beans, and coffee by taking pictures of plant leaves. If a plant(s) is found to have a disease, the App recommends necessary steps to take such as getting the pesticides and agro-chemicals, connecting with an agricultural officer for expert guidance, and also link up with fellow farmers. The intention is to realize high yields and boost the farmers' livelihoods. This solution is aimed at addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goal of No Hunger.
